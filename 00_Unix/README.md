# Directory for practical on Unix

## Notes
I used the Zulu Wikipedia for this practical. The final consonant sequences probably mostly come from English or other foreign language words, as do many of the initial sequences. Zulu does not allow generally allow final consonants. The only initial consonant clusters take the form (N)C(w), but there are many digraphs and trigraphs in the orthography.
